		<p> On Friday, reclusive rapper Donald Glover a.k.a. Childish Gambino made his return to the internet after a long, self-imposed silence in the strangest and yet most 2016 way possible. 

At exactly 3 p.m. Eastern Friday, he surprised his fanbase with a single tweet to his long-neglected Twitter account: a link to an app called Pharos. At first, following the link revealed nothing more than a drawn-out countdown and some ambient music. The suspense drove some fans up the wall as they scrambled to unpack the cryptic app.

When the timer hit zero around 6 p.m. ET Sunday, fans were left with more questions than answers. It seems Gambino has an album in the chamber, but to get first dibs, fans have to make a September pilgrimage to Southern California's Joshua Tree National Park to hear it. </p>

		<p> …Then came the theories. Of course, the obvious theories about an album dropping at the end of the countdown started circling the internet. Perhaps Donald is teasing the long-awaited Chance x Childish joint album or the possible Jaden Smith x Childish project that’s also been in speculation. </p>

		<p>  </p>

		<p>Another big question mark — I’m sure you’re all wondering what Pharos means. Pharos refers to a few things. Our best guess is that Donald is referring to Pharos, the Lighthouse of Alexandria. This is a very ancient tower that was built on the island of Pharos by the Ptolemaic Kingdom in 280 BC. It is considered to be one of the many ancient wonders of the word. </p>

		<p> So let’s think about this real quick… An ancient wonder of the world… Childish Gambino… App that travels through space… Approaches in a day… It’s kind of hard to connect the dots.

Maybe this app is one big metaphor for Donald himself. He disappeared for two years and everyone wondered where he went. He became a wonder of the world and was completely silent, but he is approaching us once again with something spectacular… and space is cool.  </p>

		<p>Who knows. Whatever is approaching better blow our minds. We have (theoretically speaking) 21 hours of angry waiting left. What do you think Donald has in store for us?   </p>

		<p> Others are saying this could be related to his other anticipated project, Atlanta, an FX show that is due to premiere this fall. But then again, why end the countdown so soon if the show doesn’t start until September?    </p>

		<p>Donald is such a multitalented guy, there’s no telling what he could be doing with this. Some people have concluded that the countdown is going to reach zero around 26 hours after it was made public, which means as of this writing, there’s only 22 hours to go.. </p>

		<p> Lynette Williams on keys seized with purpose as her lush ‘fro gave the entire congregation life. And, somehow, Gambino stood out on that ledge like a hurricane, giving us Parliament Funkadelic on one song and Earth, Wind and Fire on another. The choir rollicked as fake lightning lit up the false sky. The guitars hummed.  It was vision of the future of experiential music, featuring incredibly well-done music of black-art-past with a modern twist. A way lighted by Childish Gambino and Ludwig Goransson, specifically. It was one of the best live visual performances we’d ever seen. But, more than that, “Pharos” acted both as a glimpse into the future of how to hear an album, and as a watershed moment in how artists may choose to convey their music to listeners. In fact, “Pharos” is an order of magnitude above a mere surprise release. And will force everyone to rise to the insanely high bar he’s set with this music, concept, and experience. Maybe this app is one big metaphor for Donald himself. He disappeared for two years and everyone wondered where he went. He became a wonder of the world and was completely silent, but he is approaching us once again with something spectacular… and space is cool..</p>
